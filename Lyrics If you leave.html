        If you leave, don't leave now
        Please don't take my heart away
        Promise me just one more night
        Then we'll go our separate ways
        
        We've always had time on our sides
        Now it's fading fast
        Every second, every moment
        We've got to, we've gotta make it last
        
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd still be friends someday
        
        If you leave
        I won't cry
        I won't waste one single day
        But if you leave, don't look back
        I'll be running the other way
        
        Seven years went under the bridge
        Like time was standing still
        Heaven knows what happens now
        You've got to, you've gotta say you will
        
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd meet again
        
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd still be friends
        
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd meet again someday
        
        If you leave
        Oh, if you leave
        Oh, if you leave
        Don't look back
        Don't look back
    </pre>
