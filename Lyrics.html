    <pre>
        If you leave, don't leave now
        Please don't take my heart away
        Promise me just one more night
        Then we'll go our separate ways
        <br>
        We've always had time on our sides
        Now it's fading fast
        Every second, every moment
        We've got to, we've gotta make it last
        <br>
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd still be friends someday
        <br>
        If you leave
        I won't cry
        I won't waste one single day
        But if you leave, don't look back
        I'll be running the other way
        <br>
        Seven years went under the bridge
        Like time was standing still
        Heaven knows what happens now
        You've got to, you've gotta say you will
        <br>
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd meet again
        <br>
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd still be friends
        <br>
        I touch you once, I touch you twice
        I won't let go at any price
        I need you now like I need you then
        You always said we'd meet again someday
        <br>
        If you leave
        Oh, if you leave
        Oh, if you leave
        Don't look back
        Don't look back
    </pre>
